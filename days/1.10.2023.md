#### GCD Algorithm

Discussed the GCD algorithm and the pseudocode that would be involved in it. 

Pseudocode:
    Take Inputs
    Verify Inputs are not 0
        If Inputs are 0, end loop, produce results
    Mod the two inputs
    Let one new variable be the mod
    Mod again
    Mod and use results recursively until an output is 0 or 1
    Return results
